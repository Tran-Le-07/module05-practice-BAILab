# Module05 Research Training for BAILab
# This Data Analysis used Python to import, clean, generate statistics, and visualization of the Iris dataset.
# Steps taken:
- Loaded the dataset into a pandas dataframe
- Cleaned and filtered the dataset
- Calculated descriptive statistics
- Created a scatter plot of sepal length and petal length
- Export cleaned data and visualization
# Insights from statistics: 
- Sepal measurements vary less than petal measurements, indicating petals show more spread between flowers.
- Mean and median for each feature are close, suggesting there is no extreme skew in the distributions.
# Insights from visualization:
- The scatter plot shows clear clusters for different Iris species, meaning sepal and petal length together separate the classes well
- Species with longer petals generally also have longer sepals, indicating a positive relationship between these two features
